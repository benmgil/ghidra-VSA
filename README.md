# GhidraVSA

Part of the project for which I received my master's. Read the paper in the root of the repo for more info, and see the other part of the project [here](https://github.com/benmgil/SaTC-modified)

GhidraVSA is a plugin for Ghidra that allows the user to perform quick Value Set Analysis (VSA) from the Ghidra GUI.

You can build the project yourself, or just add the zip file in `dist/` as a Ghidra extension.
